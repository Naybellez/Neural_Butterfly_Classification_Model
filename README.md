# Neural_Butterfly_Classification_Model
Classification of ten butterfly species from the Leeds butterfly dataset. Convolutional Neural Network made with PyTorch. Achieves accuracy of over 60%

To run the trained model, set load = True in the first cell and load the pickled model, which can be trained further or evaluated in the final cell.

Alternativly run all to start training a model from scratch.
